# video-workflow

this is a practice project using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [ffmpeg.wasm](https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/).

the source video is "Caminandes: Llamigos" by Blender Studio, CC-BY licensed.

the reference sources for some snippets are labeled with a comment, but note that I may have made changes to some of the code.
